# Sales Forecasting Analysis
## Project Overview
This Project analyses Walmart's historical sales data forecasts future sales trends using the *time series analysis* techniques. Here *ARIMA* and *SARIMAX* is used for seasonal and trend patterns. The goal will be to help the shop retailers know which products are in demand, optimise inventory, and improve revenue planning.

## Objectives
* *Data Preparation & Stationarity Testing*: Process historical sales data from 2014–2018 and perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to confirm stationarity.
* *Model Selection* : ARIMA and SARIMA are used and SARIMA mostly since the data is continous and having seasonal pattern.
* *Forecasting*: Predict sales for the next four years (2018–2021) to support strategic decision-making.
